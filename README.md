# smartthings
My initial efforts will focus on getting a smartthings button (recognized by by my Smarthings hub) to be recognized by Alexa.  I'm struggling to get the imported DTH to be accepted, and get past the error of "A Device must have either a Location or a Hub ".  The pull down choices for location and hub are blank, and won't allow entries.
